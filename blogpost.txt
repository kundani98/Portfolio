Blog Post 
Intro
We will build a blog app which lets users write blog entries once they sign up with an account (
After the user registers, she can go to the homepage and login with her credentials. The navigation bar
will dynamically show different items depending on the user being logged in or out. We will achieve this
using the EJS templating engine

That is, we divide our application into three interconnected parts, Model, View and Controller:
- Model represents the structure of the data, the format and the constraints with which it is stored. In
essence, it is the database part of the application. As you might already notice, we already have that in
our models folder currently storing the BlogPost model.
- View is what is presented to the user. Views make use of the Model and present data in a manner
which the user wants. From the view, user can make changes to the data presented to them. In our app,
the View consist of static or dynamic pages rendered to users. The pages are stored in a views folder
storing various EJS files to render static and dynamic HTML websites.
- Lastly, we have Controller which controls the requests of the user and then generates appropriate
response rendered back to the user. That is, a user interacts with the View which generates the
appropriate request which is handled by the Controller which then renders the appropriate view with
the Model data as a response.
